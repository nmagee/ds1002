# DS1002 Programming for Data Science

This course exposes students to fundamental coding languages in data science. Python and R will be the primary focus of the course. Popular packages such as `pandas` and `tidyverse` will be covered in depth. Additionally, project management skills such as Git and Github will be covered.

For students somewhat new to programming of any kind, this should be a gentle introduction to working with the basic operations and data structures of two languages common to Data Science. But as good developers know, there are other pieces "around" the coding process to learn, such as setting up and working within different environments, source control using tools like `git`, and working with various types of data. These will be essential to our work in Python and R, and will undoubtedly serve other courses you take in the future.
