# Objectives

## What You Will Learn
*Understand the importance of data and programming for data science*
- Understand the relationship between data and data science.
- Understand how data is related to programming.
- Know broadly what kinds of data exist.

*Confidently work in an appropriate programming environment*
- Confidently write code in IDEs and in the command line.
- Be exposed to Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, and R Studio.
- Understand which editor is appropriate to which task.
- Find and use documents, data, and code online.

*Recognize the importance of source control and how it is used*
- Understand how to initialize a git repository and commit items to it.
- Grasp the relationship between a local git repository and a remote GitHub repository.
- Know how to pull from, push to, and submit PR's for shared repositories.

*Identify and use data types and data structures*
- Know the elementary data types for each language:
    - booleans, integers, floats, strings, etc.
- Know the elementary data structures for each language:
    - Python: set, list, dictionary, and tuple.
    - R: vectors, list, matrix, factor.
- Know some of the Python Scientific Stack:
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
- Know and perform basic operations for each data type and structure.
- Select and apply an appropriate data structure based on the problem requirements.

*Read and write to and from various data formats*
- Read text and data files from disc.
- Import data into a Pandas dataframe.

*Confidently call and write functions and methods*
- Understand the structure and use of functions for programming.
- Use built-in and import functions to perform fundamental tasks.
- Correctly pass parameters and retrieve function output(s).
- Use built-in object methods for data types and structures, e.g. string methods and dataframe methods.
- Know what vectorized functions and methods are.

*Confidently write a class and call its methods*
- Understand role of classes in organizing code.
- Understand how classes group together variables as attributes and functions as methods into encapsulated components.
- Understand how classes can inherit the variables and methods of other classes.

*Use packages to augment existing data structures*
- In Python, NumPy and Pandas essentials (e.g. simple queries and small ML computation)
- In Python and R, use a program API to utilize existing functions (e.g. assert statements.)

*Write your own modules of classes in Python*
- Write classes and organize them into modules to make your more modular.
- Make your modules sharable so that others can install them with Python's setup and install functions.
- Write documentation for your modules so that others can make sense of them.
- Write test scripts to go with your modules.
